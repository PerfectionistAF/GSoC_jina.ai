Jina AI has been selected as one of 19 organizations in Infrastructure and Cloud for Google Summer of Code 2023! GSoC is an open source internship program offering paid remote work. 

Almost anyone in the world over 18 years of age who loves coding and wants to explore the incredible world of open source can join us as a GSoC 2023 contributor.


üé• In our GSoC x Jina AI webinar, our mentors presented their projects in depth and answered questions people had about the project requirements, **[find the recording here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGr-aRhwiaA), and [here Is the slides](https://github.com/jina-ai/GSoC/blob/main/Dive%20into%20Jina%20AI%E2%80%99s%20GSoC%20projects!.pdf).**

## üîé Who are we?

<p align="center">
<b>
Welcome to the GSoC projects page of Jina AI! 
</b>
</p>

[Jina AI](https://jina.ai) provides a powerful platform for building neural-search, generative AI services with cloud-native technology, and we are thrilled to participate in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) this year. Our goal is to provide students with opportunities to work on real-world, cutting-edge projects and contribute to the growth of our community.

We are firm supporters of open source and have open sourced multiple projects, including:

- [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina) is a MLOps framework that empowers anyone to build multimodal AI services via cloud native technologies. It uplifts a local PoC into a production-ready service. Jina handles the infrastructure complexity, making advanced solution engineering and cloud-native technologies accessible to every developer. Check out the [documentation](https://docs.jina.ai/)!

- [DocArray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) is a library for nested, unstructured, multimodal data in transit, including text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, etc. It allows deep-learning engineers to efficiently process, embed, search, recommend, store, and transfer multimodal data with a Pythonic API. and [DocArray is now hosted under the Linux Foundation AI & Data.](https://jina.ai/news/donate-docarray-lf-for-inclusive-standard-multimodal-data-model/)  Check out the [documentation](https://docs.docarray.org/) and [roadmap](https://github.com/docarray/docarray/issues/780)!

## üìù How to improve your chances of being accepted?

The best way to increase your chances of being accepted as a Jina AI GSoC student is to start contributing now. Read up on [Jina's contribution documentation](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and make yourself known to the other contributors by your contributions (Preferably related to your proposal area). This way, when it comes time to evaluate student applications, you will be a recognized individual and more likely to receive the attention you need to develop a successful proposal.

We are looking for candidates who can demonstrate that they can work independently on a project. We are here to help, but we cannot monitor your progress every step of the way. Therefore, it is important to show us your motivation. Being active before the submission process is the best way to demonstrate this.
